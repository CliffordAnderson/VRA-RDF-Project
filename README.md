VRA-RDF-Project
===============
This project was initiated by members of the VRA Core Oversight Committee. The goal of the project is to develop a RDF Ontology for the VRA Core 4 data model. We have developed a draft ontology and have created an XSLT stylesheet that can convert existing VRA Core 4 compliant XML data into RDF/XML. We encourage people to try out the stylesheet and review the ontology. Your feedback will help us refine both the stylesheet as well as the ontology.
